# pomodoro_timer
just trying to work on my javascript skills. nothing special
thinking about using some youtube and spotify API as well? this might turn into something more haha
The idea is a web based pomodoro timer. Allows you to start, pause, and reset (hopefully). Simple design to allow maxmimum focus and productivity.
